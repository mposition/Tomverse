//! Server liveness heartbeat, and the downtime it makes visible (AEAB-29).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! On 2026-08-18 amux was down for 4h26m. A hardware undervoltage fault killed
//! the machine at 14:03 EDT; it came back at 15:18, but amux's LaunchAgents are
//! `Aqua` session-type, so nothing started until a human logged in at the
//! console at 18:28. The user found out the way everyone finds out — their
//! prompts stopped working — and asked what was wrong with the server.
//!
//! The product recorded the outage NOWHERE. The only evidence was a gap between
//! two lines in `server-rs.log`, and **an absence is not a signal**: nothing
//! counted it, nothing named it, and the restart emitted the same
//! `starting amux-rust` it emits after a routine 5-second auto-adopt reload.
//! Byte-identical framing for a 5s blip and a four-hour outage.
//!
//! That is ethos rule 4 — when this goes wrong, what will someone see, and will
//! they see it WHERE THEY ALREADY LOOK? So the gap is now named at WARN, stored
//! so it can be asked for after the fact (which is the only time anyone asks),
//! and published on `/health`, the endpoint every consumer already polls.
//!
//! # Why it matters beyond "amux was down"
//!
//! Every duration amux reports is measured against wall-clock time that may
//! include hours the server did not exist, and nothing marks which. On the day
//! this was written a steering message showed `queued=1 oldest_min=2131
//! reason=not-running` — some of those minutes were a genuinely wedged lane and
//! some were minutes with no server at all. Those are different faults with
//! different fixes and the log could not tell them apart. Same for schedules
//! that did not fire and rot timers that aged. [`downtime_within`] exists so a
//! reader can subtract the part that was not the lane's fault.
//!
//! # The two-process race is the dedupe
//!
//! Two amux-server processes share one DB (8823 and 8824), so a naive
//! "read stamp, then write stamp" would have both report the same outage. The
//! read and the write happen inside ONE [`crate::db::Store::write`] closure,
//! which the writer thread runs under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` — atomic across
//! processes. Whichever process gets there first sees the stale stamp and files
//! the gap; the second sees a fresh one and says nothing. One outage, one row.
