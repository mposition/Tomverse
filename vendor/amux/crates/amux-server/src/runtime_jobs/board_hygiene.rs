//! Board hygiene: age-based sweeps for needsyou and stale cards.
//!
//! Two sweeps in one job, at different cadences:
//!
//! 1. NEEDSYOU AGING (daily). Cards in `needsyou` for 14+ days get a
//!    desc_append noting the age. Cards there for 30+ days are auto-discarded.
//!    The 445-card needsyou pile (CLAUDE.md) is what happens when nothing
//!    enforces a time bound on "waiting for a human".
//!
//! 2. STALE CARD SWEEP (every 6 hours). Autofix-created todo cards older than
//!    72h are discarded (autofix files freely and most are addressed or
//!    irrelevant within a day). Backlog cards older than 30 days that were
//!    never promoted get a desc_append flagging them for review. A per-session
//!    status summary is logged each pass.
