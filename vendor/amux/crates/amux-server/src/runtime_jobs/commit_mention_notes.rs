//! Tell an open card when a merged commit names it (AMUX-3579).
//!
//! `GET /api/board/commit-mentions` has existed, been routed, and WORKED for a
//! while, and nothing called it. Zero consumers across the SPA, the bash CLI,
//! `scripts/` and the server itself. A working capability that reaches no
//! session is ethos rule 1 in its plainest form — the `mcp.json` shape, where
//! six configured servers reached 0 of 101 sessions.
//!
//! The cost of that was a whole turn: AMUX-3557 was fixed at 16:49 by a commit
//! whose SUBJECT LINE named it, sat in `todo` for seven hours, was handed to a
//! lane by auto-pickup, and cost that lane a turn establishing nothing was
//! wrong. The endpoint could have said so the whole time.
//!
//! NOTED, NEVER CLOSED, and that is not timidity. A mention is not proof of
//! completion — the endpoint's own verdict says so, because commits also
//! reference cards for context, for partial work and for reverts. AMUX-3557 is
//! the proof: closing it honestly still required checking the behaviour held
//! and proving the regression test discriminates. Auto-closing on a mention
//! would have skipped exactly the check that made the close honest, and would
//! be an agent deciding someone's work is done (ethos rule 8).
//!
//! ITS OWN JOB, NOT THE AUTOFIX TICK, because it is expensive: measured at
//! 10.6-11.1s across three consecutive calls, scanning 3 repos against 65 open
//! cards. Putting that on autofix's ~2-minute tick would stall a loop that has
//! detectors waiting behind it. Hourly is plenty for a signal about commits
//! that have already landed.
