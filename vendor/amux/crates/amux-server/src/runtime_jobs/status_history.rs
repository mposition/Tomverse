//! `session.status_decided` — a durable record of WHICH RULE decided a lane's
//! status, sampled on change (AMUX-3761).
//!
//! # The question this exists to answer
//!
//! Ethan screenshotted a lane reading WORKING + AGENTS with "Last interaction
//! 31m ago", over a pane whose visible text was the agent saying it had no task
//! queued and "Worked for 9s" — a finished turn — and asked whether that was
//! accurate. By the time the screenshot arrived the badge read `idle`,
//! `decided_by: report`, over a fresh stop-hook. Accurate NOW. Which rule fired
//! 31 minutes earlier was unrecoverable: `derive_status_explain` is computed
//! fresh per request and never persisted, and `session_events` held ZERO status
//! rows for that lane across the whole window.
//!
//! AMUX-3434 built `status-explain` precisely so a wrong badge would not cost a
//! screenshot investigation. It still did, one layer up: the instrument answers
//! "why is this WORKING right now" and every question anyone asks about a badge
//! is retrospective, because a screenshot always arrives minutes late.
//!
//! # Why a job and not the request path
//!
//! The fleet-wide derivation lives in the `/api/sessions` LIST handler, which
//! every open dashboard hits every few seconds. Recording from there is a write
//! amplified by client count, on a 2.2GB SQLite, from a GET. This job derives
//! the same verdict through the same function on its own cadence instead, so
//! the write rate is a property of the FLEET rather than of how many browser
//! tabs are open.
//!
//! # The row rate, measured before this shipped
//!
//! Sampling `/api/sessions` every 15s for 306s over 52 running lanes: **7
//! status changes, 82.4/hour, ~1,978 rows/day**, concentrated in four lanes
//! (nissan 3, radio-canada 2, tubescience 1, gtm-engine 1). That is a LOWER
//! BOUND on status alone — this job also records a change of `decided_by` at an
//! unchanged status, which is the more interesting case and adds rows — and an
//! UPPER bound in the other direction, because a 20s tick misses flips a 15s
//! probe caught. Call it single-digit thousands a day.
//!
//! Against a `session_events` table already holding 208k rows, 14-day retention
//! puts this at roughly a doubling in the worst case and tens of MB on a 2.2GB
//! database. Bounded, and the prune is wired on the same day as the writer
//! rather than after someone notices.
//!
//! # It is a SAMPLE, and the payload says so
//!
//! At a 20s tick, a lane that flips active -> idle -> active inside one tick
//! records one row or none. That gap must not read as "the status never
//! changed", so `status-explain` publishes the cadence beside the history and
//! `history_recorded_since` distinguishes "this lane has been stable" from
//! "this job has not been running long enough to know" (ethos rule 4).
//!
//! SAMPLING IS THE LOAD-BEARING CHOICE, not a convenience, and the reviewer's
//! argument for it is better than the one this module shipped with (random,
//! 2026-08-26): the badge in the original incident flipped because a report's
//! trust window AGED OUT, and nothing fires when a window expires. Status is a
//! pure function of (report age, pane, subagents, clocks) evaluated on read, so
//! an event-driven hook can catch a report landing or a pane repaint and is
//! structurally blind to a time-driven flip — which is precisely the class of
//! bug this feature chases. Only sampling observes the whole space.
//!
//! ONE EDGE WHERE "EMPTY IS HONEST" LEAKS, recorded rather than hidden: the
//! guarantee holds for RUNNING lanes, each of which gets a baseline row on its
//! first census. A lane that has NEVER run returns `history: []` with a
//! non-null `history_recorded_since`, which reads as "stable and sampled" when
//! the truth is "never in the census". Benign, because a lane that never ran has
//! no live badge to interrogate — but it is a leak, and making it airtight means
//! separating "seen in a census at least once" from "never seen" on the read
//! path.
//!
//! TICKS CANNOT OVERLAP, which is what makes it safe for these rows to carry no
//! idempotency key: `spawn_periodic_every` is a single
//! `loop { tick.tick().await; f().await; }` with `MissedTickBehavior::Delay`, so
//! a slow tick delays the next one rather than running beside it. Two concurrent
//! ticks would read the same `prev` and both insert the same change row.
