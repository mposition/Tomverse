//! Compaction-generation watch (AMUX-3742).
//!
//! The report was "the raw claude code terminal is performing better than amux
//! claude code, same model same prompt". It was true, and nothing in amux could
//! say why, so it stayed a feeling.
//!
//! Measured 2026-08-26 across every transcript active since 08-05: model and
//! effort were IDENTICAL on both sides (both `claude-opus-5` at `xhigh`, both
//! ~57k first-turn input tokens). What differed was compaction generations —
//! amux lanes median 8, mean 20, max 215; raw terminal sessions median 0, mean
//! 3.1. A lane resumes the same conversation forever, so it answers from a
//! summary of a summary while a fresh terminal reads primary sources.
//!
//! This job is the "and make it surface in the logs" half of that fix. The
//! remedy (`amux fresh <lane>`) is the other half, and it is deliberately never
//! automatic: a conversation is the lane's accumulated work, so deciding it is
//! spent belongs to its owner (ethos rule 8). This job reports; a human acts.
