//! `/api/events` — SSE (RR-0023/RR-0042, Invariants 35/26).
//!
//! One stream, three event kinds:
//! - Revisioned StateEvents (`{"type":"state",...}`) + gap detection
//!   (`lagged`) + `hello` carrying the current rev.
//! - `{"type":"invalidate","keys":["board"|"sessions"|"messages",...]}` — the signal
//!   that replaced the legacy full-list pushes (AMUX-3503). The old dialect
//!   shipped the ENTIRE board (883KB) + sessions (177KB) on every connect
//!   and every coalesced change, RAW — CompressionLayer exempts
//!   text/event-stream — while the client's fetch path was already gzipped
//!   AND ETag'd, so intermittent mobile paid ~1MB per reconnect for data a
//!   conditional fetch serves as a 304. Worse, half the push was DEAD: the
//!   server said `"type":"sessions"`, the client only handled `workers`
//!   (the AF-10 vocabulary-rename class), so 177KB per push was parsed and
//!   dropped for weeks. The client now fetches on invalidate through the
//!   cheap path; a burst of N writes still coalesces to one signal.
//! - The 10s `{"type":"ping"}` keep-alive (the SPA's 18s staleness detector
//!   feeds on it, and its `v` drives stale-shell self-reload — which is
//!   also what migrates an old full-push client off this contract within
//!   seconds of connecting to a new server).
