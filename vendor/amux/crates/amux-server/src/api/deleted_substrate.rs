//! `GET /api/board/deleted-substrate` — closed cards whose files no longer exist.
//!
//! AMUX-3608, spun out of AMUX-3606, which found ONE card (BACKE-3183) asserting
//! a shipped, reviewed fix whose entire substrate was deleted at 792ce1f. The
//! question this answers is whether that was a one-off or a class.
//!
//! # The method the parent card proposed is wrong, and it was run before it was
//! checked
//!
//! AMUX-3606 suggested sweeping cards whose `desc` cites the deleted filename.
//! Measured: 151 cards cite it, 127 done/verified, 73 closed "before" the
//! deletion. Then the positive control ran, and BOTH halves of that predicate
//! missed the one instance known to be positive:
//!
//! - BACKE-3183's `desc` does not contain the string at all. Its evidence lives
//!   in the `log` column, against a 10,178-character desc with zero hits. A
//!   `desc LIKE` cannot see it.
//! - Its `updated` is 03:18 that morning because two sessions wrote to it that
//!   night. `updated` is LAST TOUCH, not close time, so filtering closed cards
//!   by it measures who typed most recently.
//!
//! 73 was a confident wrong number of exactly the shape ethos rule 7 warns
//! about: a filter that feels like a measurement because you ran a command.
//!
//! # The method that works
//!
//! A closed card's `log` names the COMMITS that closed it (``05:03`` `commit
//! 63d64c1 — ...`). Resolve each sha, list its paths, check whether they still
//! exist. No text heuristics; nothing depends on anyone having typed a filename.
//!
//! Controlled on BACKE-3183, where it discriminates AND splits the card in half,
//! which a per-card grain would have lost:
//!
//! ```text
//! 63d64c1  DELETED  amux-server.py, tests/test_upstream_dirt.py
//! 9df0195  DELETED  amux-server.py
//! c2d57ed  ALIVE    amux                  (the `amux board reviewer` verb)
//! 41ed4bf  ALIVE    frustrations.md
//! ```
//!
//! The verdict is PER COMMIT. "Half of this card survived" is the common case
//! and the useful one.
//!
//! # It SURFACES, it never closes, and it is not a reopen trigger
//!
//! A deleted path is not proof the behaviour is gone: it may have been ported
//! under a new name, and most of these were ported deliberately and correctly.
//! That judgment belongs to a human or the owning session (ethos rule 8). So the
//! honest headline is "N cards cite work whose files no longer exist", NEVER
//! "N regressions", and the endpoint mutates nothing. Same discipline as its
//! sibling `commit_mentions`.
//!
//! # The trap that would have made this report zero
//!
//! `git diff-tree --stdin` requires FULL 40-character shas. Given an abbreviated
//! one it prints the sha line and NO paths, silently — so every card would have
//! come back with an empty path list and the check would have reported a clean
//! board. Measured here before it shipped, not reasoned about. `git cat-file
//! --batch-check` does the expansion for every sha in ONE process and marks the
//! ones this repo does not have as `missing`, which is also how a sha belonging
//! to a different repo is told apart from a sha that resolves to nothing.
