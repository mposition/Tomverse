//! Email intelligence: what matters to the owner, inferred, then applied to the
//! inbox (AMUX-3998).
//!
//! # The split, and why it is the whole design
//!
//! Ethan asked for an inbox scored and ranked by "properties that are important
//! to the user", where those properties are inferred from the themes of the
//! messages he sends amux, recomputed periodically, using the Meta-task model
//! from Settings.
//!
//! That decomposes into two very different jobs, and keeping them apart is the
//! point:
//!
//!   THEMES are judgment. What does this person actually care about? Only a
//!   model can read 200 messages and answer that, and it is worth a model call.
//!   It runs PERIODICALLY, over the corpus, once.
//!
//!   SCORING is arithmetic. Given the themes, does this email match them? That
//!   is string and sender matching over a few hundred bytes, and spending a
//!   model call per message would be ethos rule 2 exactly — "spend model calls
//!   on judgment, not string manipulation" — while also making the inbox cost
//!   money to open and impossible to rank offline.
//!
//! So the model is asked ONE question periodically and the inbox is ranked from
//! its answer instantly, for free, as many times as you like.
//!
//! # Which model
//!
//! `mdai::resolve_model(None)`, which is `AMUX_HELPER_MODEL` — the "Meta-task
//! model" in Settings, the same knob that already drives Look Up, orchestrate
//! routing and worker summaries. Named there once, read here; no literal is
//! spelled at the call site, so the tier improves when the setting does (ethos
//! D3).
//!
//! # Honesty about the measurement
//!
//! A ranked inbox with no themes is indistinguishable from a ranked inbox whose
//! themes say nothing, and both would render as "everything scores 0". So the
//! themes document carries `measured`, `n_considered` and `why_unmeasured`
//! alongside its content, and every ranked response repeats them. A zero score
//! next to `measured: false` is a probe that never ran; next to
//! `measured: true, n_considered: 187` it is a genuine "this email is not about
//! anything you have ever asked for". Those are different facts (ethos rule 4).
