//! Google service-account domain-wide delegation (AMUX-3347). Mints an
//! impersonated OAuth access token for a scope by signing a JWT assertion
//! (RS256) with the service-account private key and exchanging it at Google's
//! token endpoint. This lets the Mixpeek Google connectors (Gmail send, Drive,
//! Calendar, ...) act as a Workspace user WITHOUT a per-user browser OAuth grant.
//!
//! SECURITY: the SA private key lives ONLY in the key FILE (its path is
//! `GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE`; the impersonation subject is `GOOGLE_SA_SUBJECT`). This
//! module reads the file to sign and NEVER logs the key or the minted token. The
//! token-endpoint error IS surfaced — Google's `unauthorized_client` names the
//! missing scope, which is the Workspace-Admin-console fix a human must apply.
