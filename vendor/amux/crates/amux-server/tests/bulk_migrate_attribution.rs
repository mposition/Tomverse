//! A column sweep must be able to say who did it (AMUX-4755).
//!
//! Measured from the live issues table before this shipped: 373 cards
//! discarded in one minute on 2026-09-15, 123 on 09-16, 202 across six
//! minutes, 25, 29 — every one recorded as `api-anonymous`, because the
//! dashboard is not a worker and sends no `X-Amux-Session`. The cost was a
//! wrong diagnosis: two bursts landing in the same minute on consecutive days,
//! with no actor on either, read as a runaway daily job, and a peer lane
//! re-filed on that basis and was preparing to hunt for the job.
//!
//! These drive the REAL router, so what they pin is the shipped path: the
//! handler's resolution order, what it writes on each card, and what it
//! refuses to claim when there is no credential to verify.
//!
//! Its own process, because `require_bearer` is a router-wide layer and this
//! file needs one app with an owner token configured and one without.
