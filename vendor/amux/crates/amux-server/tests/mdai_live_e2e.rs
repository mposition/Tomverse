//! LIVE e2e for the `.mdai` computed-file engine (AMUX-3240), using REAL files
//! and the REAL fast model.
//!
//! This test creates real text/markdown files and a folder in a temp dir, builds
//! a small multi-node DAG with various edge prompts, and runs it through the real
//! model. It asserts STRUCTURAL eval criteria rather than exact output:
//!
//! - the output is non-empty and references source content,
//! - execution is upstream-first (the entry node runs last),
//! - a history entry is recorded and returned newest-first,
//! - a cyclic graph errors, naming the cycle,
//! - changing a source changes the output.
//!
//! It SKIPS cleanly (loud, printed reason) when no model is configured, exactly
//! like the live-Chrome tests skip without a browser, so CI without model
//! credentials stays green. The gate is a real probe: build the real client and
//! ask it a trivial question; if that fails (no CLI, no auth), skip. A probe
//! beats guessing which of several credential sources is present.

// CLAUDE.md tells every lane to run `scripts/test-contended.sh -p amux-server`
// before pushing, and this test called a real model and asserted on its free
// text. On 2026-09-16 it failed while gating an unrelated search migration: the
// model declined and asked for the files instead of reading them, so the
// three-way OR looking for "zephyr"/"72"/"marlow" matched nothing. The same
// test had passed 40 minutes earlier on the same code.
//
// The assertion is not the weak part. It is already about as forgiving as an
// assertion on free text can be, and no amount of loosening helps, because a
// refusal contains none of the tokens by construction. What cannot be fixed by
// a better matcher is that the model's WILLINGNESS is an input the test does
// not control.
//
// `model_available()` is kept: an opt-in run on a box with no model still skips
// with a printed reason rather than failing. It cannot carry this on its own,
// because it probes with "reply with ok" and a model can answer that and then
// decline the real task, which is exactly what happened.
//
// NOT TAKEN: classifying a refusal in the task output as a skip. That is a
// matcher over model free text competing with a moving target, and it would
// keep a live model call in the push path to do it. Once the test is out of
// that path a refusal costs nobody a wrong diagnosis, so the cheap fix and the
// robust one are the same fix here.
