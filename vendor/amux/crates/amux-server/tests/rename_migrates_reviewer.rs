//! A rename must carry a lane's name on EVERY column that addresses it
//! (AMUX-3751).
//!
//! The cascade migrated `issues.session` — the card's owner — and left
//! `issues.reviewer` and `issues.shepherd` pointing at the dead name. So
//! renaming a lane silently orphaned every card that had asked it to review
//! something: the card still reads `review`, which looks healthy, while the
//! reviewer nudge is addressed to a session that no longer exists.
//!
//! Measured on the live board 2026-08-26: two cards still named `amux-rust`
//! as reviewer, a lane renamed to `amux` long ago, and 7 open cards sat in
//! `review` naming a reviewer that resolves to no registered worker at all.
//!
//! This RUNS the shipped statements against a real SQLite table rather than
//! restating the list. A test that asserts "the array contains a reviewer
//! entry" is green whichever SQL that entry holds, and green against a
//! typo'd column name that fails only in production.
