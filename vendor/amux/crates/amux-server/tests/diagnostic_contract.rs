//! Every diagnostic endpoint says whether its measurement RAN (AF-320).
//!
//! `frustrations.md` carries 41 `AREA: instruments` entries out of 83, plus 24
//! more in the archive. No other area is close. The shape is the same every
//! time: the measurement returns a clean value, the value is wrong, and nothing
//! beside it says the probe could not have produced a right one.
//!
//! - AMUX-3772 — the latency card named an innocent endpoint, confidently backwards.
//! - AMUX-2644 — a worker whose pane died at launch reports `running: true` / `idle`.
//! - AR-111   — the request log recorded a ~15s restart choreography as a 76ms request.
//! - AEAB-42  — the disk ranker cannot rank a file, so it could never have named the 1.8GB one.
//! - AMUX-2841 — a probe read a hook file git never executes; a correct
//!   measurement certified the wrong conclusion.
//!
//! Ethos rule 4 already states the remedy: any output that can read zero or
//! empty must publish, in the same payload, whether the measurement ran. That
//! is a rule which asks people to remember, and half the ledger is people not
//! remembering. This test is the mechanical half.
//!
//! It enumerates the diagnostic families out of `ROUTE_TABLE` rather than a
//! list kept here, so a NEW diagnostic route is in scope the moment it is
//! mounted. That is the property worth having: a hand-maintained list in a test
//! only covers the endpoints someone remembered to add, which is the failure
//! mode being fixed.
