//! `GET /api/sessions` shells out to enumerate the fleet. Five of those calls
//! were bare `.output()`, which blocks until the child exits with no timeout —
//! and one of them, a `pgrep`, ran once per shell pane, so a 50-lane fleet did
//! ~50 unbounded spawns per cache miss (TTL 2s).
//!
//! MEASURED: /api/sessions max latency was 697,890ms in the 24h window of
//! 2026-08-28, across eight concurrent requests that all ended within one
//! second of each other — the shape of several callers blocked on the same
//! wedged external process. That starved the runtime and 500'd the dashboard
//! (AF-300).
//!
//! The file has carried `run_bounded` the whole time, whose own WARN says
//! "capture blocked GET /api/sessions for as long as tmux took". The fix
//! existed; these call sites bypassed it. This test is why they cannot again.
