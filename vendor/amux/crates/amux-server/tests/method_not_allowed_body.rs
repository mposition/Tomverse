//! A 405 must SAY SO IN ITS BODY (AF-211).
//!
//! axum's method-not-allowed is `405` + `allow:` + a ZERO-LENGTH body. Correct
//! HTTP, and invisible to every recipe in this repo: CLAUDE.md's documented
//! idiom is `curl -sk <url>` with no `-i`, so a wrong method prints nothing at
//! all. Measured 2026-08-24 against the live server on `GET
//! /api/git/staged-guard` (POST-only): zero bytes out. The natural reading of
//! silence is "no such endpoint", which sends the reader hunting for a missing
//! route instead of changing one word in their command.
//!
//! That is ethos rule 7's empty-probe shape, except the server produces it —
//! and the answer was in a header the documented idiom never displays.
//!
//! This is an INTEGRATION test on purpose. The behaviour lives in a middleware
//! wrapped around the finished router, so a unit test of the handler could not
//! reach it, and the property is precisely that it applies to a route nobody
//! special-cased.
