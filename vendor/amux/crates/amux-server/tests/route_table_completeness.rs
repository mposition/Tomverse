//! ROUTE_TABLE COMPLETENESS: a mounted route must appear in the table
//! (AMUX-4668).
//!
//! `tests/route_table.rs` already walks the table against the real router and
//! can fail in two directions: a path CLAIMED but not routed, and a listed path
//! whose methods are under-listed. Both walks start from ROUTE_TABLE.
//!
//! That leaves one direction structurally uncoverable there: a path mounted by
//! the router and ABSENT from the table entirely is never probed, because the
//! walk has no entry to probe from. axum's Router cannot enumerate its routes,
//! so the missing enumeration has to come from somewhere else. It comes from
//! the source here.
//!
//! MEASURED COST, 2026-09-17. `POST /api/board/{id}/fan-out` shipped mounted
//! and unlisted. Everything downstream of the table then reported it as
//! missing: `GET /api/debug/routes` (which calls itself "the routing truth")
//! omitted it, and the `route.callers_have_routes` invariant failed with "no
//! route matches this path" while the route was answering 409. That filed an
//! autofix card whose stated fault did not exist.
//!
//! WHY A SOURCE SCAN IS THE HONEST INSTRUMENT HERE, and what it cannot do: it
//! reads `.route("…")` literals, so a route mounted through a helper or a
//! computed path is invisible to it. It therefore reports how many modules and
//! routes it actually covered, and refuses to pass on a scan that found
//! implausibly little. A completeness check that silently covered nothing would
//! be the exact failure it exists to prevent.
