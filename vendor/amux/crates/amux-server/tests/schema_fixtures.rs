//! Test fixtures build the `issues` schema FROM the migrations (AF-328).
//!
//! Four test fixtures used to hand-write `CREATE TABLE issues (...)` mirroring
//! `migrations/`, and nothing kept them in step. The failure when one fell
//! behind was badly misleading: `COLS` selects the new column, `prepare` fails,
//! an `unwrap_or_default()` swallows the error, the query returns `None`, and
//! the test reports its OWN assertion. Migration 0037 produced 38 failures
//! across `board_drive` and not one mentioned a schema or named a column — the
//! top one read "the 3-day-old card must be worked before the fresh one,
//! left: None", which sends you to read the scoring logic. Migration 0036 cost
//! the same tax.
//!
//! Converting them to `migrate::test_memdb()` also surfaced that the fixtures
//! were more PERMISSIVE than production, which is the sharper half: they
//! declared `title TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` and `created INTEGER NOT NULL
//! DEFAULT 0` where the real schema has no defaults, and they created
//! `statuses` EMPTY where the migrations seed it. So tests were passing against
//! constraints that do not exist. Drift does not only hide columns.
//!
//! This guard is what stops a literal coming back. It reads the source rather
//! than the schema, because the hazard is textual: someone adds a fixture by
//! copying an old one.
