//! `/api/board/contract` must document the list filters that actually exist,
//! and must not document ones that do not (AMUX-2933, reported by ts-gke).
//!
//! The filters worked and were documented NOWHERE — "discoverable only by
//! guessing", in the report's words. The cap was worse than undocumented, it
//! was silent: a lane auditing its own board got the 100 most-recently-updated
//! TERMINAL rows fleet-wide with nothing in the body saying so, which is how
//! `GET /api/board` came to return FEWER of a lane's done cards (4) than
//! `?session=<lane>` did (102). A list that drops rows with no signal reads as
//! data, not as truncation — and ts-gke was one step from reporting "only 4
//! done cards exist".
//!
//! So this test exists to stop the DOC drifting from the CODE, which is the
//! failure that would put the silence back. It compares the documented filter
//! names against `ListParams`' real fields, in BOTH directions.
