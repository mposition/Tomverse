//! Every `amux board <verb>` the server tells an agent to run must be a verb the
//! CLI actually dispatches.
//!
//! AMUX-2140 is the incident this guards: every assignment notification told
//! sessions to run `amux board claim <id>`, the verb did not exist, the CLI fell
//! through to its help text and exited 0 — so following the instruction EXACTLY
//! produced a success signal and no claim. Nothing could catch that by being
//! careful, because the instruction and the failure were the same action.
//!
//! AMUX-3707 found two more of the same class in one nudge, three years of
//! firings later: the decompose ask told lanes to "discard it" (the `discard`
//! alias does dispatch, but it was missing from `amux board` help, so it was
//! undiscoverable) and to "set each child's `epic`" (no verb existed at all,
//! while `epic` was a real PATCH field reachable only by hand-rolled curl —
//! which drops the worker header and produces exactly the unattributed writes
//! the ledger depends on not having).
//!
//! So this does not pin one string. It extracts every command the SERVER emits
//! into a lane's context and checks it against the CLI's own dispatch table. A
//! new nudge that names a verb nobody implemented fails here instead of in a
//! lane at 3am.
