# EXTRACTS THE PYTHON FROM THE SHIPPED `amux`, rather than restating it. A
# control built from the same text the code is built from cannot fail — which is
# exactly the defect being fixed here, one layer up: the old line read `$_R` with
# an empty-string default, so no input could change its output and it still read
# as a measured attempt number.
#
# The retry path only runs when the server is unreachable on the first try, so
# there is no way to exercise it end to end without taking the server down. This
# drives the block's own bytes with the environment the shell hands it.
