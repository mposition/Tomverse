amux service watchdog — EXTERNAL liveness for the rust server (com.amux.server-rs).

# Why this exists at all, given launchd and the in-process invariant monitor

Three things watch the server, and they cover different failures. Keeping them
straight is the whole design:

  * **launchd `KeepAlive`** (com.amux.server-rs.plist) normally restarts a
    process that EXITS. It cannot see a process that is alive and wedged, and a
    newly replaced ad-hoc-signed binary can leave it stuck at EX_CONFIG until
    the agent registration is refreshed.
  * **The in-process invariant monitor** (`crates/amux-server/src/invariants/`)
    checks SEAMS on a 30s tick: route contract, config provenance, queue
    liveness. It is excellent at "two subsystems disagree" and structurally
    blind to "this process is dead", because if the process wedges the monitor
    wedges with it. A monitor cannot report its own death.
  * **This file** covers both gaps: a process is ALIVE but does not answer
    `/health`, or launchd has failed to restore a dead listener. Both failure
    modes have occurred on this host.

So the watchdog is retargeted, not retired (AMUX-2618). What it is NOT allowed
to do is anything the other two already do, or anything a human should decide.

# What changed on 2026-08-09 (the cutover fix)

The previous version supervised the RETIRED python service and had fired as
recently as 19:42 that day: it kickstarted `com.amux.server` (a label that no
longer resolves), decided that had failed, and then invoked
`claude --print --dangerously-skip-permissions` with a prompt instructing it to
edit `amux-server.py` (deleted), commit, and **`git push origin main`** — on a
SHARED checkout carrying other sessions' unpushed commits. It survived only
because that invocation happened to die on a signal. An unattended agent with a
push instruction is not a watchdog, it is a deploy with no operator, and it is
exactly the call CLAUDE.md's Deploy section reserves for a human. That path is
deleted, not fixed.

Deleted with it: the CPU and memory branches. `/health` on the rust server
serves no `cpu_percent`/`memory_mb`, so both read absent keys as 0 and could
never fire — and the CPU trigger had already been disabled once for tripping on
a baseline (ethos rule 7: a threshold below the baseline reports that the
machine is ON). What remains is only signals that are ABSENT in the healthy
state.

# The refused/hung split

`connection refused` and `connected but silent` are different faults with
different owners, and collapsing them is what made this thing noisy:

  * **refused** — nothing is listening. Short self-adoption gaps are normal, but
    two consecutive observations mean KeepAlive has demonstrably failed. The
    watchdog first kickstarts the exact service and, if macOS still reports a
    dead service, reloads that service's exact plist before escalating.
  * **hung / degraded** — the port answers but `/health` does not, or answers
    `store != ok`. Nobody else can see this. This is the one case we act on.

# Exercising the failure path

A watchdog nobody has watched fire is theatre. `WATCHDOG_DRY_RUN=1` logs the
action it WOULD take instead of taking it, and `WATCHDOG_HEALTH_URL` points it
at an arbitrary endpoint, so all three verdicts can be provoked against a fake
server without touching the live one. See the AMUX-2618 verification in the
card. Keep that affordance working.
