# WHY THIS EXISTS. `Amux-Session` is read from $AMUX_SESSION, which is an
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE and therefore travels to every child process. Any process
# that inherits it — a subagent, a script, a session that wandered into this
# checkout — writes commits indistinguishable from that lane's. `Amux-Conversation`
# is a LOOKUP of that same variable, so it cannot corroborate it: a wrong stamp
# produces a wrong conversation id identically and the pair reads as doubly
# confirmed. Measured on 2026-08-30: four commits stamped to a lane that did not
# make them, and two agents citing the two fields to each other as agreeing
# sources.
#
# `Amux-Agent` is walked from the hook's own PROCESS ANCESTRY, which no env var
# can move. The property below is the whole point and it is stated as an
# invariance: change $AMUX_SESSION to anything you like and the agent field does
# not move.

# A CONTROLLED ANCESTOR, because the ambient one is not a test input.
#
# Cells 1 and 2 used to run the hook directly and read whatever `claude` process
# happened to be above the test. On a dev box that is the session running it, so
# they passed; in CI there is no claude anywhere in the tree, `Amux-Agent` is
# correctly omitted, and both cells failed on an empty string. They had never
# been green in CI: the first CI run that reached them (33396997200, 2026-08-31)
# went red on exactly these two, and stayed red for the fleet until this fix. A
# cell whose verdict depends on who launched the test measures the launcher, not
# the hook.
#
# A symlink named `claude` gives ps an argv[0] whose basename matches the hook's
# binary test, which is the same "match the binary, not the substring" rule the
# hook documents. A copied binary does not work on macOS (code signing kills
# it), which is why this is a symlink and not a cp.
