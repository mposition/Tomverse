# Tests for mac-pressure-tripwire.sh.
#
# WHAT BROKE (AMUX-4661): `sysctl` lives in /usr/sbin. The script called it bare,
# and the PATH it actually runs under has no /usr/sbin, so the pressure level and
# the swap reading both came back empty and two of the three thresholds could
# never trip. A memory fire alarm that cannot read memory.
#
# THIS SUITE HAS TO STRADDLE TWO PLATFORMS, and saying so is the point. CI is
# `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` (.github/workflows/checks.yml) and this script reads
# Darwin-only sysctls (kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level, vm.swapusage). So the
# cell that proves the bug is gone can only run on a Mac. Wiring a Darwin-only
# assertion into a Linux runner is how ea07267a turned a green step red earlier
# the same day; the skip below is deliberate and it PRINTS, so a reader never
# mistakes "did not run" for "passed".
#
# What that leaves on Linux is a source-level cell. It is a weaker instrument
# than the behavioural one and it is not nothing: it fails if anyone deletes the
# export or moves it below the first probe, which is the regression that would
# actually happen.
# -e per the AF-561 ratchet: without it a harness prints PASS after calling a
# helper that does not exist.
