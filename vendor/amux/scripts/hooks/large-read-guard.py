"""Claude PreToolUse router for large, untargeted text reads.

The primary model keeps the user's question and all engineering judgment. A
full read above AMUX_BULK_READ_LINES (default 350) is refused with the exact
`amux delegate read` command that compresses caller-supplied bytes through the
configured helper model. Ranged reads of at most the threshold remain available
for edits and debugging.

This is routing, not a security boundary. It handles Claude's Read tool and the
ordinary direct-output shell readers that commonly bypass it. Pipelines and
redirections are allowed because their output is already being narrowed before
it enters context. Any parser/probe failure is fail-open and audit-logged.
