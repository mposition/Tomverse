# The dashboard's send-time stamp must be applied EXACTLY ONCE (AF-360).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `sendToSession` prefixed every non-slash message with
# `[HH:MM AM]` and had no guard against text that already carried one. Measured
# live on MSG-35221, whose stored text is:
#
#   "[10:00 AM] [11:32 PM] where are we at with all of the items from the ingestion MD?"
#
# Re-sending is ordinary — Ethan re-asks by pasting the text back out of the
# transcript, and the offline queue replays an already-built payload — so this
# was reachable on the normal path, not an edge case.
#
# The consequence is not cosmetic. The reader strips a SINGLE leading stamp
# (`strip_context_wrapper`, crates/amux-server/src/opencode/events.rs), so the
# survivor is a 10.5-hour-stale timestamp that reaches the model looking exactly
# like a real one. The lane is told a time that is not when the message was sent
# and has no way to tell which of the two is now.
#
# It drives the SHIPPED functions extracted from app.js, never a retyped copy:
# a copy passes forever while the real one rots, which is the failure this file
# exists to prevent (ethos rule 7).
