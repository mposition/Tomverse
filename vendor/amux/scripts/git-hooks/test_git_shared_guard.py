    # it on the exact pattern CLAUDE.md recommends for this checkout: build a
    # tree against a temp GIT_INDEX_FILE, then commit-tree, so you never cp into
    # a worktree other lanes are using. They were told "bare `git commit` would
    # sweep 47 file(s) of index-vs-HEAD DRIFT" about a command that reads
    # neither the index nor the worktree and structurally cannot sweep anything.
    #
    # The documented escape did not fit either: AMUX_ALLOW_SWEEP_COMMIT=47
    # asserts an intent to commit 47 files, which was false, so taking it would
    # have put a wrong claim in the audit trail. They hand-built the commit
    # object with `git hash-object -t commit -w --stdin` instead.
    #
    # Swept the sibling verbs rather than only the reported one: `add` and
    # `fetch` have real hyphenated forms too.

    # makes it reach the `-a/--all` matcher, which refuses with "commits EVERY
    # modified tracked file" about a command that reads the object database and
    # never touches the index. Measured on the unfixed guard: rc=2.
    # THE PRIMARY CELL: launch-videos' exact command. QUOTING is the variable
    # that makes it reachable — the scrubber blanks quoted strings, so the tree
    # operand disappears and _commit_has_pathspec stops exempting it, and the
    # sweep verdict fires. Measured against HEAD's guard: rc=2 "would sweep",

    # AMUX-3932: COMMAND SUBSTITUTION INSIDE A QUOTED ARGUMENT.
    #
    # THE INCIDENT. A lane built a JSON body whose PROSE quoted the very commands
    # its card was about. Bash substituted them and actually ran `git add -A`,
    # staging 779 paths across the shared checkout, 765 of them other lanes'.
    # Nothing destructive armed and it was repaired with a scoped reset, but the
    # staged-guard was down at that moment and logged NOT ENFORCED, so nothing
    # caught it either.
    #
    # THE DEFECT was not "python3 bodies are treated as prose" (that hypothesis
    # was tested and did not reproduce). It was that the scrubber could not tell
    # an INERT quoted region from one bash will EXPAND. Two independent regex
    # passes ran over the whole string, so single-quote stripping also fired
    # INSIDE double-quoted regions where those quotes are literal characters --
    # which is why the two substitution syntaxes disagreed in exactly one place.
    #
    # THE CONTROLS ARE HALF THE POINT. Stripping quoted bodies is RIGHT: it is
    # what lets a lane file a card whose text mentions a guarded command. A fix
    # that blocked every mention would pass the bypass rows below and make the
    # guard unusable, which is the noise the stripper exists to prevent.
    #
    # Matrix reproduced against the live guard by amux and independently by
    # mixpeek-homepage-claude, each feeding crafted strings on stdin so nothing
    # executed. Their run caught a broken harness first (main() returns 0 unless
    # tool_name == "Bash"), which is why every row here goes through run_hook.
