"""amux PreToolUse guard — block IRREVERSIBLE tree-wide git in SHARED checkouts.

A shared checkout (e.g. ~/Dev/mixpeek) holds many sessions' uncommitted work in
one tree. A tree-wide discard sweeps up or destroys EVERY session's work (two
data-loss incidents 2026-07-02). We block only the irreversible discards;
path-scoped git and recoverable ops (bare stash, pull --rebase --autostash) pass.

Matching is scoped to ACTUAL git invocations: quoted-string contents are stripped
before matching, so a subcommand merely MENTIONED in prose/JSON (e.g. a curl body)
never trips the guard.

Owner-sanctioned override: write the exact authorized command to
~/.amux/guard-allow-once (after owner sign-off). The next matching invocation is
allowed once, the marker is consumed, and the override is audit-logged. This
gives authorized cleanups a clean path instead of training reflog evasion.

Configure guarded roots via AMUX_SHARED_CHECKOUTS (colon-separated; default
~/Dev/mixpeek). Fail-open: any error lets the command through.

Managed workers also get corrective feedback for rm/rmdir operands with an
unchecked variable directory prefix. Claude's native empty-path check otherwise
opens an interactive prompt even in bypass mode. This denies the tool call; it
never grants permission or executes/expands the proposed command.

# GIT'S GLOBAL-OPTION PREFIX, shared by every detector that must find a
# SUBCOMMAND in command text (AF-489).
#
# mixpeek-frustrations fixed the run_dir resolver on 2026-09-04 (2815f442) after
# `-C` was read as git's global `-C <dir>` when it was `git commit -C <commit>`,
# and handed the rest of the file over. Two DETECTORS had the mirror defect: they
# allowed only `' + GIT_GLOBALS + r'` before the subcommand, so any OTHER global flag
# hid the subcommand and the guard never fired at all. Measured before the fix:
#
#   git -c user.name=x commit --amend         amend detector MISS
#   git -c a=b -c c=d commit --amend          MISS
#   git --no-pager commit --amend             MISS
#   git -c a=b -C /repo commit --amend        MISS
#   git -c protocol.version=2 checkout -- .   discard detector MISS
#   git --literal-pathspecs checkout -- .     MISS
#
# A resolver that mis-resolves gives a wrong answer. A DETECTOR that misses is a
# SILENT PASS, which is the worse direction and the one this closes.
#
# Arg-taking globals are enumerated because they consume the next token; every
# other leading dash-token is a no-arg global. The group stops at the first bare
# word, which is git's own rule for where the subcommand begins, so `git log
# --oneline` and `git diff -C -- a b` still do not match.

    # 2026-08-29 20:19 ET: something ran a depth-limited fetch against the shared
    # ~/Dev/mixpeek. `git rev-list --count origin/main` fell from ~38,700 to 50 and
    # a 15:41 commit became a parentless root. For four hours every lane asking "is
    # fix X in sha Y" from that tree got a wrong NO for anything older than that
    # afternoon — with no error and no output — while GitHub's compare said
    # ahead=163/141/318 for the same three pairs (tubescience, TUBES-2339).
    #
    # The caller is still unknown, and that is exactly why this belongs in the
    # guard: nothing in the repo does this (scripts/, .githooks/, server/scripts/
    # and tools/ were grepped; the only local --depth is a `clone --depth=1` of an
    # EXTERNAL repo into its own directory, which cannot shallow this checkout). So
    # it came from a session, and the guard is the only layer that sees those.
    #
    # The same trap hit CI independently the same day: a
    # `git fetch -q --depth=1 origin <sha> <sha>` followed by `merge-base
    # --is-ancestor` produced a false "REVERT DETECTED" for hours (MG-1532). The
    # fetch added to guarantee the commits were present is what removed the
    # ancestors the walk needed.
    #
    # Why this is a guard rule rather than a fix at one consumer: mixpeek-cicd
    # already made `scripts/graft-push.sh` refuse to run on a shallow repo (leg 23,
    # 4de6dbeb8e). That is detection at ONE consumer. It does not stop the next
    # depth-limited fetch and does not help the other ~49 lanes doing ancestry by
    # hand.
    #
    # SCOPE, each part deliberate and independently re-tested here (8 block / 10
    # pass, zero false positives):
    #   * fetch|pull only. `clone --depth` creates a NEW repo and cannot shallow
    #     this one; blocking it false-positives on real callers.
    #   * `--unshallow` and `--deepen` stay allowed — they are the remedy, and
    #     "deepen" does not contain "depth" so there is no overlap.

    `git commit -m` then committed the ENTIRE index-vs-HEAD drift — 1120 files,

    `git diff --cached` is against HEAD, and graft-push freezes HEAD ~1846

    exactly the drift, which is why a plain file-count threshold would refuse
    real refactors and this does not.

    On an ordinary checkout HEAD and origin/main agree, the drift set is empty,

    amend requires PROOF OF INSPECTION — the caller must have looked at HEAD
    and pinned it: `AMUX_AMEND_EXPECT=<head-sha> git commit --amend ...`.
    Allowed iff the pinned sha == actual current HEAD AND HEAD is not already
    pushed (published history is never amended on shared trunk).

    THE PIN NARROWS THE RACE, IT DOES NOT KILL IT, and this docstring used to
    claim otherwise ("kills the race where a foreign commit lands between your
    commit and your amend"). That claim is false whenever anything DELAYS the
    command between this hook admitting it and git executing it, because the
    check happens at ADMISSION and nothing re-verifies at execution.

    Measured 2026-09-03 (mixpeek MC-1624, self-disclosed by mvs-research against
    themselves): they pinned correctly, their command then waited 30 iterations
    on .git/index.lock held by another lane's commit, and by the time the amend
    ran HEAD was that other lane's commit, which it rewrote. They had read this
    docstring, concluded the pin was sufficient, and followed the documented
    procedure exactly. A guard that overstates its coverage turns a careful
    operator into a confident one.

    So the lock check below is a LARGE, CHEAP REDUCTION, not a proof. Closing
    the class needs a re-verify at execution time, and git has no atomic
    compare-and-amend to build it from. Do not restore the "kills the race"
    wording.

    # sends them into a loop. The transient reason must not mask the permanent
    # one.
    #
    # NOT COMPLETE, deliberately stated: a command admitted while the lock is
    # ABSENT can still block on a lock taken a millisecond later. That
    # refinement is mvs-research's, made against their own proposal. This

    # A LOCK IS NOT ALWAYS A LIVE PEER, which is why this AGES it. Git's own
    # error says so: "a git process may have crashed in this repository earlier
    # ... remove the file manually to continue". On a ~40-lane checkout a
    # crashed or SIGKILLed git is not rare, and a naive refuse-on-present turns
    # a stale lock into "every lane's amend is refused forever, blaming a peer
    # who is not there" (mvs-research, who hit the lock state twice in one
    # evening while reviewing this patch).
    #
    # THE THRESHOLD IS GENEROUS ON PURPOSE. `git commit` holds this lock across
    # its hooks, and on the mixpeek checkout pre-commit routinely runs for
    # MINUTES: commits of 2 to 9 minutes were measured on 2026-09-03 and one
    # pre-push gate ran 917s. A 120s cutoff would call a legitimately-held lock

    # window this check exists to close. 900s is longer than any commit observed
    # here and far shorter than a lock nobody has noticed.

# The blocked path is the literal string `2>`, in the same message that explicitly
# cleared both real paths. Dropping `2>&1 | head -30` let the identical command
# through. The `&` inside `2>&1` truncates the tail regex mid-token, which is what
# leaves a bare `2>` behind; a fused `2>/dev/null` survives whole and is just as
# wrong.
#
# Two costs, and the second is the one that makes this worth a helper. The guard
# stops the entire Bash call, so one phantom token vetoes a command whose every
# real path the guard already cleared. And the refusal names a nonexistent file as
# another session's work, which reads as a genuine ownership conflict and invites a

    """AC-212 (2026-08-04): block a PATH-SCOPED discard that would destroy ANOTHER
    session's uncommitted work.

    The guard above covers only TREE-WIDE destroys and its own docstring says
    path-scoped ops "pass". That exemption was written for multi-directory repos,
    where naming a path really does narrow the blast radius to your own work. It is
    exactly inverted in a SINGLE-FILE repo: `git checkout -- amux-server.py` names
    one path, and that one path holds every session's edits. I destroyed a peer's
    uncommitted fix that way while reverting my own ~20 lines; `git diff --stat`
    had said 63 insertions and I never asked whose the other 43 were.

    Why this direction deserves a guard MORE than the two that already have one:
    committing or pushing a peer's work is RECOVERABLE — the content is in the
    object store, revertable, and the PASSENGER convention names it. Destroying
    unstaged work leaves no object and no reflog entry. amux guarded both
    recoverable directions and left the unrecoverable one open.

    Detection is deliberately narrow, because a false block on `git checkout <branch>`
    would be worse than the gap:
      - checkout: only with an explicit `--` separator (a branch switch has none)
      - restore:  skipped when --staged/-S is present WITHOUT --worktree/-W, since
                  that only unstages and the worktree content survives
      - `.` is left to the tree-wide patterns above
    Attribution is not guessed here: it reuses POST /api/git/staged-guard, which is
    already generic ({session,dir,paths} -> foreign) rather than commit-specific, and
    derives ownership from each session's own JSONL transcript.

    Fail-open on anything unexpected, same posture as the rest of this guard.
