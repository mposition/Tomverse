# AMUX-3789 — the gh shim must inject the App token, defer to an explicit one,
# never recurse into itself, and fail OPEN when the minter is broken.
#
# It runs against a FAKE gh and a FAKE get-token.sh in a throwaway PATH, so no
# cell reaches GitHub, mints a real token, or depends on network. The fake gh
# prints the identity it was handed, which is the only thing these cells assert.
#
# CELL 5 IS THE CONTROL. Every other cell asserts the shim DID something; cell 5
# asserts it delegates untouched when the caller already chose an identity. A
# shim that always injected would pass 1-4 and silently replace a CI token.
#
# Exit 0 = pass, 1 = failure.
