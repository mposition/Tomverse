# AF-468 — one second-person body reaching a SECOND lane silently misattributes work.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The check shipped verified only by hand, and the four cases
# lived in a commit message. A fixture in a commit message does not run. ts-gke, who
# reported the bug, made the point that decided it: knowing WHICH cases are real and
# which are constructed is part of what a fixture is worth, and that provenance had
# nowhere to live either.
#
# EXTRACTS the shipped function rather than reimplementing it, and pulls its callees
# transitively — the lesson of scripts/test-unstamped-ledger.sh, where AMUX-40 swapped
# a bare `curl` for `_curl`, the harness did not follow, and three assertions blamed
# the ledger for a missing dependency.
#
# Exit 0 = pass, 1 = failure.

PASS=0; FAIL=0
# POSITIVE CONTROL COUNTER (ts-gke). Four of the six cases assert SILENCE, and a
# check that is dead is silent — so a totally broken check still passes them. They
# proved it: neutering the pronoun regex on a copy of the CLI scored 5 of 8, which
# READS as a partial regression and IS total failure. The suite's whole
# discriminating power lives in the FIRE cases, so the run refuses to report a
# verdict unless at least one of them actually fired.
