"""Bound a local Cargo process group; never signal a worker or another build.

Sampled limits, not kernel reservations: a process can overshoot between probes.
The caller holds cargo-target-guard's lease throughout supervision and cleanup.

A BROKEN PROBE IS NOT A BROKEN BUILD (AMUX-4758). Every limit here except the
wall-clock timeout is measured by shelling out to `du` or `ps`, and both of
those time out when the box is loaded — which is exactly when peers are most
active and when a lane most wants its commit to land. Measured 2026-09-17 at
load average 121: `du` timed out three times, this script killed a healthy
`cargo check`, then raised PermissionError out of its own cleanup and printed a
traceback. The commit was refused and HEAD did not move; the same tree passed
clippy clean minutes earlier and again on retry once load fell to 55.

So an unmeasurable limit degrades to UNENFORCED AND SAID SO, never to a refusal.
The script already knew how to say it could not measure — it emitted
`cargo_budget_unmeasured` with `measured: false` three times before aborting —
and then aborted anyway, which is ethos rule 3: a constraint with no truthful
path through. The budget itself stays; AMUX-70 is real.

It also fails LOUDLY IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, which is why the traceback matters
as much as the abort: a Python stack out of a pre-commit gate reads as a broken
toolchain, and the next lane to see it goes looking for a Rust problem that does
not exist. Cleanup here never raises, and `main` cannot emit a bare traceback.
