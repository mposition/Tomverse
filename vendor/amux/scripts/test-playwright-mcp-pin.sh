#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The playwright-mcp wrapper must name a VERSION, never `@latest` (AMUX-3989).
#
# WHY. `npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest` puts an upstream release on this fleet
# with no amux commit behind it: nothing to review, nothing to bisect, and the
# moment of change is whenever some lane's npx cache happened to expire.
# Measured 2026-08-31: the cache held 0.0.68, which is what the fleet was
# running, while `@latest` resolved to 0.0.79. Browser lifecycle is exactly
# where an unreviewed upstream change is expensive — see epic AMUX-3988.
#
# Reads the SHIPPED script. No network, no npx, no browser: this cell must give
# the same answer on a laptop and on a CI runner, which is the property three
# separate tests failed to have today (AMUX-3962, AMUX-3969, AMUX-3974).
