# AF-621 — a lane declaring `--depends-on` must be told what the link does NOT do.
#
# THE DEFECT: `board request` says "a terminal callback to the requester is armed
# by default", and `board add --depends-on` said only "link the new card to one it
# depends on". A reader carries the symmetry across and expects the board to push
# when a declared dependency clears. It does not: the parent-walk lives inside the
# terminal-callback dispatcher, behind `let Some(target) = row.callback_session`,
# and a lane cannot set that field by declaring a dependency. The card becomes
# eligible and board-drive picks it up on a later tick, so the real behaviour is
# latency, not loss — but nothing said so, and primis held a 45-minute heartbeat
# as a fallback specifically because they could not tell which it was.
#
# ASSERTS ON THE RENDERED OUTPUT, not the source. Both usage blocks are
# `cat <<EOF` with an UNQUOTED delimiter, so backticks in them are command
# substitution: my first cut wrote "use `board request`" and the help rendered
# "use ,". The source looked right and `bash -n` passed. Only running it shows it.
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure.
