# AMUX-4732: the scratch report reaches each lane as a CARD, and only when the
# bytes are actually attributable to that lane.
#
# THE CELL THAT MATTERS MOST IS ambiguous_files_nothing. The report emits
# `AMBIGUOUS:19-candidates` for a workspace 19 lanes share. Delivering that is 18
# wrong cards, each costing a real recipient a read and a judgement, and it is
# the cheapest mistake for this script to make because the row LOOKS complete:
# it has a size, a class, and an owner field that is populated.
#
# HERMETIC. Runs against a fixture TSV and a stub `amux` on PATH, so no real
# board is touched and no real lane is asked for anything. The stub is also what
# lets the refusal cell exist at all: `cross_board_create_forbidden` is a real
# 403 a worker hits, and there is no way to provoke it on purpose against the
# live board without filing something somewhere.
#
# -e per the AF-561 ratchet: without it a harness prints PASS after calling a
# helper that does not exist.
