#
# The Rust side is unit-tested in lib.rs (self_adopt_enabled, both directions).
# This pins the other half, which is the half that silently rots: a seam nobody
# sets is decoration, and the ethos file's first rule is about exactly that —
# mcp.json shipped six servers that reached 0 of 101 sessions because the flag
# enabling them was never passed.
#
# Two properties, and the second is the one a careless edit breaks:
#   1. serve-head.sh exports AMUX_NO_SELF_ADOPT=1
#   2. it does so BEFORE it exec's cargo — an export after the exec line is
#      unreachable, and would look completely correct in a diff.
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure. Wired into .github/workflows/checks.yml.
