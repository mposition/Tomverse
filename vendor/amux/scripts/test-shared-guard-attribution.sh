# Cells for git-shared-guard.py's DISCARD REFUSAL WORDING (AF-423).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The block itself is right and well covered by use: `git
# checkout --` on a shared checkout is unrecoverable and refusing it is correct.
# What had no coverage is the ATTRIBUTION inside the refusal, and that is where
# it was wrong: the server sends `owner: "(unknown)"` with `peer: false` when
# there is NO peer record, and this guard rendered the placeholder as a name —
# "(recently edited by (unknown))", closing with "or ask (unknown) first".
#
# The sibling guard has branched on `peer` since AF-24. This one had not, which
# is the same shape as AF-410 and AF-420: a fix that reached one emitter of
# several. So the property worth pinning is not "does it block" but "does it
# name somebody it cannot support naming".
#
# The cells exec the SHIPPED renderer lifted out of the hook file, not a retyped
# copy, so the strings under test are the strings that ship (ethos rule 7).
