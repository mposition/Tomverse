# An mdai run must never enter the offline outbox (AF-371).
#
# WHAT ETHAN SAW, as two separate reports that turned out to be one bug:
#   "mdai files are stuck at running"
#   a banner reading `Syncing 0/1 · POST /api/files/mdai/run` that never cleared
#
# THE MECHANISM. The window.fetch interceptor queues a failed mutation and hands
# the caller a synthetic 202 `{ok:true,queued:true}`. `_mdaiRun` checked only
# `!r.ok || d.error`; a 202 is ok and carries no error, so the SUCCESS branch took
# it, the panel reported a completed run, and no run had left the browser. The
# queued op then sat in the outbox as an unfinished sync.
#
# ORDINARY PATH, not an outage: the auto-builder restarts the server on every
# commit, so any run straddling a deploy hits this. A run is 82-127s.
#
# Two independent guards, and this file pins BOTH, because either alone leaves a
# real hole: the skip entry stops this url being queued, and the caller-side check
# stops any other path handing the panel a 202 it reads as output.
#
# Drives the SHIPPED functions extracted from app.js, never a retyped copy.
