# test-harness-wired.sh — AF-346, one level up.
#
# AF-346's incident: the a99955f7 dashboard regression was caught by a guard that
# ALREADY EXISTED, was correct, and would have blocked the commit. It did not
# run. The fix made the RUNNER say what it skipped. This checks the layer above
# it, where the same failure is invisible for longer: a harness that nothing
# invokes at all.
#
# MEASURED at the time this was written: 80 scripts/test-* harnesses, 48 named by
# a workflow or a git-hook, 32 named NOWHERE. Among them was
# scripts/test-target-clause.sh, the harness written FOR AF-346, which had never
# run in CI. A guard nobody calls is indistinguishable from a guard that passes,
# and it is worse than no guard, because it is counted as coverage.
#
# THIS IS A RATCHET, NOT A SWEEP. Wiring 32 harnesses at once would turn a check
# nobody has run into a required gate for every lane on the same afternoon, and
# some of them compile. So the 32 are recorded as a BASELINE and this fails only
# on a harness that is unwired and NOT in it. Number 33 cannot arrive quietly;
# the existing 32 stay someone's deliberate decision instead of my sweep
# (ethos rule 8).
#
# The baseline also SHRINKS: an entry naming a file that no longer exists, or one
# that is now wired, is an error. A stale allowlist is how a ratchet becomes a
# rubber stamp.

# Every place a harness can legitimately be invoked from. Kept explicit rather

# harness's docstring is not wired, and a whole-repo grep would call it wired.
# scripts/test-selector-clauses.sh names test-target-clause.sh in a comment,
# which is exactly the false positive this avoids.
#
# COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED, and this file's first run is why. The line above used to
# `cat` the workflow whole, so the comment I wrote in checks.yml explaining that
# test-target-clause.sh is deliberately NOT wired made it read as wired, and the
# stale-baseline cell fired on it. A mention is not an invocation, which is the
# exact distinction the paragraph above claims and the first cut did not make.
# YAML comments and the bash comments inside a `run: |` block both start with #,
# and neither invokes anything, so one rule covers both.
