# Who must you ask before `git push origin main`, and who CANNOT be asked?
#
# CLAUDE.md's Deploy block says "If foreign commits exist, ask their author
# before pushing." That instruction has no truthful path when the author is an
# ISOLATED lane: an isolated worker refuses sends carrying a worker origin, so
# only the owner can reach it from the dashboard. The state is completely
# legitimate — an isolated lane is supposed to commit to shared main and
# somebody else is supposed to push it — and the two available moves are to
# push unasked while a MANDATORY rule says otherwise, or to never push. Everyone
# picks the first and nobody records that they did (AF-548, found live
# 2026-09-07 when amux-homepage's consent poll named 16 of 23 commits and missed
# 5 belonging to an isolated `amux`).
#
# A NAMED EXEMPTION IS A TRUTHFUL PATH; SILENCE IS NOT (ethos rule 1: when you
# exempt something from a loop, name what still reaches it). So this prints the
# unaskable authors as their own section, by name and with the reason, for the
# pusher to state rather than not know.
#
# It also prints, per lane, how many commits touch NO Rust — because the gates
# people offer as push evidence (`cargo clippy --workspace`, `cargo test -p
# amux-server`) are scoped to a LANGUAGE and get quoted as a verdict on a RANGE.
# In the run that produced this script, 10 of 23 commits touched no .rs file at
# all, including the commit belonging to the lane that asked for consent. A
# workspace clippy said nothing whatsoever about it, and "exit 0" looks total.
#
# Usage: scripts/push-consent.sh [<base>] [<tip>]     defaults: origin/main HEAD
set -uo pipefail

BASE="${1:-origin/main}"
# THE TIP DEFAULTS TO HEAD, NOT `main`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
#
# CLAUDE.md tells every lane to run its gates on a DETACHED worktree, because a
# check in the shared checkout reads peers' uncommitted files. On a detached
# worktree `main` is a stale local branch ref that has nothing to do with the
# commits you are about to push, so the old default silently answered about the
# wrong range and printed "Nothing to push.", a FALSE CLEAR on the one gate
# whose entire job is to stop a push that should have asked somebody first.
# Measured 2026-09-16 on a worktree holding one unpushed commit: `commits 0`.
#
# HEAD is right in both shapes: on a checkout sitting on main, HEAD IS main.
