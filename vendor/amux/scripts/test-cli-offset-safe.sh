# AMUX-3891: the bash CLI must be readable in one parse, because it is rewritten
# in place underneath running interpreters as a matter of routine.
#
# THE BUG THIS PINS. bash does not slurp a script. It reads and executes
# incrementally, holding an open fd and a byte offset. `~/.local/bin/amux` is a
# symlink straight into the working tree (deliberately — that liveness is the
# point), ~50 lanes invoke it constantly, and the file is edited constantly. Every
# editor write, `git checkout`, `git stash` and branch switch rewrites it in place
# while somebody is mid-invocation, and bash then resumes at an offset pointing
# into different bytes.
#
# Observed 2026-08-29 20:28 by mixpeek-homepage-claude: a `board retitle` whose
# write SUCCEEDED, then died with `line 3784: syntax error near unexpected token
# ';'` and exit 2. `bash -n` on the same path passed immediately after — the file
# was fine, the PARSE was not.
#
# The spurious exit is the benign outcome. A caller checking exit codes reads 2 as
# a failed write and retries, and `board retitle`/`status-update` are not
# idempotent for a reader. A shifted offset can also land mid-function and execute
# a fragment of a command, which is unbounded.
#
# THE SHAPE. Everything after the preamble lives inside one `{ ... }` compound
# command, and the last two statements are `exit "$?"` and `}`. bash must then
# parse to the closing brace before executing anything, and the trailing `exit`
# means it never seeks back to the file afterwards.
#
# WHY A SHAPE TEST AND NOT ONLY A RACE TEST. The race repro is real and was run
# (30 trials each: unwrapped 6 BROKEN / 24 clean, wrapped 0 BROKEN / 30 clean) but
# it is a RACE — a green race run is consistent with "the shape is gone and we got
# lucky", which is exactly the silent-green this repo keeps getting bitten by. The
# shape is the invariant; assert the invariant. The race proved the shape matters,
# once. This proves the shape is still there, every run.

# missing builtin as a broken CLI, which is what the first version of this did.
