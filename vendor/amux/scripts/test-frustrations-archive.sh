# AF-243 — the RETIREMENT tool had no test, and it is the one that DELETES.
#
# scripts/frustrations-archive.py removes an entry from frustrations.md and writes it
# to frustrations-archive.md. That is the only sanctioned way an entry leaves the
# ledger, it is destructive to the source file, and it shipped with zero coverage —
# then gained a whole new code path (`--superseded`, the third disposition) on
# 2026-08-26, still with none.
#
# THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS is not "the entry ended up in the archive". It is that the
# ledger loses EXACTLY the target entry and nothing else. A tool that took one extra
# entry, or truncated the tail, would satisfy every naive assertion — the target is in
# the archive, the target is gone from the ledger — while silently destroying a
# neighbour. So the cells below pin the SURVIVORS, by name, on both sides.
#
# THE CARD WRITE IS UNREACHABLE HERE, ON PURPOSE. `carry_to_card` is best-effort by
# design: the archive is what makes a move recoverable, so a failed card write must
# never block the move or leave an entry half-retired. Pointing it at a closed port is
# therefore not a limitation of this harness, it is the cell that proves the asymmetry
# holds — the entry must still move, and the failure must be REPORTED rather than
# swallowed.
#
# HOW THE ISOLATION IS ACHIEVED, and the first version got this WRONG. Setting
# AMUX_URL does NOT work: `_api()` in the tool runs `amux url` first and falls back to
# a hardcoded literal, and never reads AMUX_URL at all. That is CORRECT of the tool —
# CLAUDE.md mandates `$(amux url)` over `$AMUX_URL` precisely because a lane's env can
# carry a stale port (AMUX-3046) — so the fix belongs here, not there.
#
# The cost of getting it wrong was visible in the live request log the next morning:
# `404 PATCH /api/board/{id}` with the literal `X-2` twelve times, this harness's own
# fixture id, hitting the REAL board. Harmless only because X-1/X-2/X-3 do not exist.
# A fixture that reused a real card id would have mutated production, and cell (c)
# would have passed either way — it asserted the write was reported as failed, which
# a 404 from the live board satisfies just as well as a dead port.
#
# So the isolation is now STRUCTURAL: a stub `amux` earlier on PATH answers `url` with
# a closed port, which exercises the tool's REAL resolution path and yields a dead
# endpoint. Cell (z) asserts the stub is the one being resolved, because an isolation
# that silently stops working is exactly what happened last time.
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure.

# while /api/health showed uptime_s=11 moments later. This box swaps the server
# binary on every commit, so a batch archive reliably straddles one.
