# Cells for the staged-guard hook's unaccounted-lines RENDERING (AF-342).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The server-side decision has unit tests in git_guard.rs, but
# what a lane actually experiences is what this hook PRINTS, and that half had
# no coverage at all. The defect being fixed was entirely a printing volume
# problem: 93 lines of "matching nothing you edited firsthand" on commit
# 40fa0ce0, across four files written start to finish by one session with no
# peer involved. Nothing was wrong with the verdict; the noise was the bug.
#
# A warning that fires on the normal path is one people learn to scroll past,
# and it takes the real signal with it, so "stays silent when it should" is a
# behaviour worth pinning rather than trusting to a future reader's restraint.
#
# The cells exec the SHIPPED rendering block lifted out of the hook file, not a
# retyped copy: the strings under test are the strings that ship (ethos rule 7).
