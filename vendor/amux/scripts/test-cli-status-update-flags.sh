# MHC-377 — regression coverage for a silent data-loss bug in
# `amux board status-update`.
#
# THE BUG. The verb took `local text="$*"` with no flag guard, so a flag handed
# to it became the message:
#
#   amux board status-update MHC-376 --outcome-file /tmp/notes.txt
#     -> prints "MHC-376 -> status update posted", exits 0
#     -> records the literal string "--outcome-file /tmp/notes.txt"
#     -> the file's contents are never read and never sent
#
# Four writes were lost that way in one session, and twelve in an earlier one
# (MG-1441, 2026-08-13). Nothing in the output separates it from a real write,
# which is what makes it expensive: the ledger looks written-to and a reviewer
# believes it.
#
# The help invited it, printing "Every status verb above takes the
# gate-satisfying flags ... --outcome-file <path>" in a block listing this verb,
# when those flags belong only to the status-CHANGE verbs. Both halves are
# fixed; this pins the behaviour half.
#
# WHAT IS PINNED, and why each direction is here. A guard that only ever refuses
# is as broken as one that never does, so the accept cases carry equal weight:
# the refusals must not POST, and prose/--stdin/--file must reach the wire with
# their bytes intact.
#
# Runs against a throwaway listener on a random port. Nothing here can touch the
# real board.
