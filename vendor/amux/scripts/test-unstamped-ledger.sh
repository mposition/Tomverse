# AMUX-2626 / AMUX-2670 — the unstamped-send ledger must actually reconcile.
#
# When the server is unreachable, `amux send` falls back to raw tmux, which
# drops provenance, the audit row and delivery verification. AMUX-2670 covers
# that: record the send to a LOCAL ledger and flush it to POST /api/history as
# `raw-tmux-fallback` on the next send that reaches the server, so an unaudited
# send and a send that never happened stop looking identical.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. That mechanism had never fired: zero `raw-tmux-fallback`
# rows in cmd_history, all time, and no pending file. Zero is the one-output/
# two-states shape — it reads the same for "the fallback genuinely never
# happens" (good) and "the ledger is broken and every fallback send is lost"
# (the exact failure it was built to prevent). A safety net nobody has ever seen
# catch anything is a safety net nobody has tested.
#
# It cannot be exercised by sending: a real fallback TYPES INTO A PEER'S PANE.
# So this drives the two shipped functions directly, against an isolated
# CC_HOME, and asserts the row lands server-side with the right type and origin.
#
# Exit 0 = pass, 1 = failure, 2 = skipped (server unreachable — the test needs a
# live /api/history and says so rather than passing vacuously).

# TRANSITIVELY. Extracting a function without its callees is the same rot this
# file was built to catch, one layer down, and it had already happened: AMUX-40
# (978645c0) swapped the bare `curl` inside _flush_unstamped_ledger for the
# hang-guarded `_curl` helper, which this test did not extract. `_curl` was then
# an undefined command, its rc-127 hit the flush's own "server went away
# mid-flush: KEEP the row" branch, and three assertions went red reading:
#
#   FAIL — the row never reached /api/history — every fallback send would be lost
#
# A green server, a working POST (verified by hand), and a test insisting the
# audit trail was broken. The diagnosis pointed at the mechanism; the defect was
# in the harness reading it. So walk the call graph instead of naming three
# functions and hoping the list stays complete.

# 5. WHAT THE FALLBACK TELLS ITS USER (AF-454). Sections 1-4 prove the ledger
#    reconciles. This one proves the tool SAYS SO, which is a separate claim and
#    was false for as long as the ledger has existed: the closing message ended
#    "no origin stamp, no audit" and was printed one line AFTER
#    _record_unstamped_send wrote the audit row.
#
#    That cost a real measurement pass. gtm-engine hit a server flap on
#    2026-09-03, read "no audit" literally, and filed a provenance gap that
#    AMUX-2670 had already closed; their own send was in the trail the whole
#    time as MSG-40621 (type raw-tmux-fallback, origin "unstamped-fallback from
#    gtm-engine"). A mechanism the user is told does not exist is a mechanism
#    that does not reach them (ethos rule 1).
#
#    Asserted against the SOURCE, deliberately. This block cannot be executed
#    without typing into a peer's live pane, which is the same reason sections
#    1-4 drive the functions directly instead of sending. A static assertion
#    that can fail beats a dynamic one that cannot run.
#    And it reads ONLY the `echo` lines. The first draft of this check matched
#    the whole block and went red against the FIXED code, because the comment
#    explaining the old wording quotes "no audit" verbatim. A check that reads
#    the prose around a line instead of the line is pinned to the wrong layer,
#    and would have passed just as happily on a revert that kept the comment.
# THE RAW TMUX FALLBACK IS GONE, and this section now pins its ABSENCE (AMUX-4771).
#
# What was here asserted the wording of the fallback's closing block, extracted
# with `sed -n '/^  _record_unstamped_send /,/^  return 0$/p' amux`. That pattern
# expects the CALL SITE, indented two spaces inside the send path. There is no
# call site: `_record_unstamped_send` appears exactly ONCE in ./amux, its own
# definition at column 0, and it has appeared once at HEAD~200, HEAD~80 and
# HEAD~20 too. The block has not existed for the whole window anyone can check.
#
# It is not a regression, it is a deliberate removal. The terminal path now
# writes a `send_delivery_unknown` row with `raw_fallback: False` and says so to
# the sender: "No raw terminal paste was attempted." `_flush_unstamped_ledger`
# stays live because the comment above it says why -- "Historical fallback
# ledgers still flush" -- and it is still called on every acknowledged send.
#
# AND THE OLD CHECK COULD NOT SAY ANY OF THAT. Under `set -euo pipefail` the
# zero-match grep aborted the whole script AT THE ASSIGNMENT, before its own
# `if [ -z "$BLOCK" ]` could report "this check proves nothing" and before the
# summary line printed. The last thing a reader saw was an `ok`, so a run that
# died read as a clean pass. That is AF-561 in mirror image: no match is a
# legitimate answer and needs `|| true`.

# 6. WHAT THE RECEIVER SEES (AF-455) -- now pinned as an ABSENCE (AMUX-4771).

#    This section asserted the shape of the raw INJECTION: that the body carried
#    a marker rather than arriving bare, that the marker said "NOT
#    server-verified" rather than claiming an identity, and that the audit row
#    kept the undecorated text. Every one of those is a good property OF A
#    FEATURE THAT NO LONGER EXISTS.
#
#    ./amux says so itself, right above the ledger: "direct terminal pasting was
#    removed after the TubeScience stacked-draft incident (AMUX-4359)". There is
#    no `-l "$marked"` line, no `local marked=`, and no `_record_unstamped_send`
#    call site anywhere in the CLI.
#
#    So the concern this section carried is now satisfied by construction: a
#    peer message cannot be shape-identical to an owner prompt if no peer
#    message is ever typed into a pane. What is worth pinning is that it STAYS
#    removed -- reintroducing it would revive AF-455 and AMUX-1818 together.
#
#    THE OLD VERSION COULD NOT REPORT THIS. `KEYS=$(grep ... | head -1)` matched
#    nothing and, under `set -euo pipefail`, aborted the script at the
#    assignment -- before its own "this check proves nothing" arm and before the
#    summary. Same bug as section 5, the same line apart.
