# returns 0, and `tmux new-session -d` returns immediately. So `started` counts
# SPAWNS THAT RETURNED, not workers that came up. fleet-boot.sh independently
# reads /api/sessions and logs what is actually running. On the boot of
# 2026-08-30 those two disagreed by six -- `55 started, 0 failed` beside a
# verdict naming 7 workers down, 6 of them in start-all's own started list --
# and the boot exited 0. Both numbers were already in this script; nothing
# compared them.
#
# Runs the SHIPPED fleet-boot.sh, with AMUX_BIN and AMUX_FLEET_BOOT_BASE pointed
# at stubs. No real worker is ever started by this file.
