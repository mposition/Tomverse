#
# THE DEFECT: the flag has worked since 99763834 and appeared on NEITHER help
# surface. gtm-engine hit three specimens in one session where a hand-discarded
# capture shell produced "closed the request without resolving the dependency ...
# evidence: not recorded" while the work sat safely on a sibling card, and when
# they went looking for the flag that fixes it they found nothing. A capability
# nobody can name is a capability nobody has (ethos rule 1).
#
# ASSERTS ON RENDERED OUTPUT, because these are heredocs and a swallowed
# backtick or a dropped continuation is invisible in the source (AF-621).
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure.
