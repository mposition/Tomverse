 * SQL constructs are not functions, so they cannot be schema-qualified.
 *
 * Migrations here are hardened by pinning `search_path` and writing
 * `pg_catalog.` in front of the functions they call, so a search_path a caller
 * controls cannot shadow one. That is right for functions. It is wrong for the
 * handful of things that *look* like functions and are parsed as expressions --
 * `COALESCE` and the rest below are SQL constructs, and `pg_catalog.coalesce(…)`
 * is a call to a function that does not exist.
 *
 * It fails at apply time with `42883`, which means the whole migration chain
 * stops: on 2026-09-18 eight of them in one migration took every DB integration
 * job on `develop` red, and the error named an unrelated migration from a year
 * earlier. Cheap to write, expensive to find.
